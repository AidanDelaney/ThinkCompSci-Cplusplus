\chapter{File Input/Output and {\tt apmatrix}es}

In this chapter we will develop a program that reads and writes files,
parses input, and demonstrates the {\tt apmatrix} class.  We will also
implement a data structure called {\tt Set} that expands automatically
as you add elements.

Aside from demonstrating all these features, the real purpose of the
program is to generate a two-dimensional table of
the distances between cities in the United States.
The output is a table that looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
Atlanta 0
Chicago 700     0
Boston  1100    1000    0
Dallas  800     900     1750    0
Denver  1450    1000    2000    800     0
Detroit 750     300     800     1150    1300    0
Orlando 400     1150    1300    1100    1900    1200    0
Phoenix 1850    1750    2650    1000    800     2000    2100    0
Seattle 2650    2000    3000    2150    1350    2300    3100    1450    0
        Atlanta Chicago Boston  Dallas  Denver  Detroit Orlando Phoenix Seattle
\end{verbatim}
%
The diagonal elements are all zero because that is the distance
from a city to itself.  Also, because
the distance from A to B is the same as the distance from B
to A, there is no need to print the top half of the matrix.

\section {Streams}
\index{stream}

To get input from a file or send output to a file, you have to
create an {\tt ifstream} object (for input files) or an
{\tt ofstream} object (for output files).  These objects
are defined in the header file {\tt fstream}, which you
have to include.

\index{header file}

A {\bf stream} is an abstract object that represents the flow
of data from a source like the keyboard or a file to a destination
like the screen or a file.

We have already worked with two streams: {\tt cin}, which has type
{\tt istream}, and {\tt cout}, which has type {\tt ostream}.
{\tt cin} represents the flow of data from the keyboard to
the program.  Each time the program uses the {\tt >>} operator
or the {\tt getline} function, it removes a piece of data
from the input stream.

\index{cin}
\index{cout}
\index{istream}
\index{ostream}

Similarly, when the program uses the {\tt <<} operator on
an {\tt ostream}, it adds a datum to the outgoing stream.

\section {File input}
\label{finput}
\index{file!input}
\index{ifstream}

To get data from a file, we have to create a stream that flows
from the file into the program.  
We can do that using the {\tt ifstream} constructor.

\begin{lstlisting}
  ifstream infile ("file-name");
\end{lstlisting}
%
The argument for this constructor is a string that
contains the name of the file you want to open.  The result
is an object named {\tt infile} that supports all the same
operations as {\tt cin}, including {\tt >>} and {\tt getline}.

\begin{lstlisting}
  int x;
  string line;
    
  infile >> x;               // get a single integer and store in x
  getline (infile, line);    // get a whole line and store in line
\end{lstlisting}
%
If we know ahead of time how much data is in a file, it is 
straightforward to write a loop that reads the entire file and
then stops.  More often, though, we want to read the entire
file, but don't know how big it is.

There are member functions for {\tt ifstreams} that check the status
of the input stream; they are called {\tt good}, {\tt eof}, {\tt fail}
and {\tt bad}.  We will use {\tt good} to make sure the file was
opened successfully and {\tt eof} to detect the ``end of file.''

\index{stream!status}
\index{good}
\index{eof}
\index{end of file}

Whenever you get data from an input stream, you don't
know whether the attempt succeeded until you check.  If the
return value from {\tt eof} is {\tt true} then we have reached
the end of the file and we know that the last attempt failed.
Here is a program that reads lines from a file and displays
them on the screen:

\begin{lstlisting}
  string fileName = ...;
  ifstream infile (fileName.c_str());

  if (infile.good() == false) {
    cout << "Unable to open the file named " << fileName;
    exit (1);
  }

  while (true) {
    getline (infile, line);
    if (infile.eof()) break;
    cout << line << endl;
  }
\end{lstlisting}
%
The function {\tt c\_str} converts an {\tt string} to a
native C string.  Because the {\tt ifstream} constructor
expects a C string as an argument, we have to convert
the {\tt string}.

\index{c\_str}
\index{C string}
\index{string!native C}

Immediately after opening the file, we invoke the {\tt good} function.
The return value is {\tt false} if the system could not open the file,
most likely because it does not exist, or you do not have permission
to read it.

\index{loop!infinite}
\index{infinite loop}

The statement {\tt while(true)} is an idiom for an infinite
loop.  Usually there will be a {\tt break} statement somewhere in
the loop so that the program does not really run forever (although
some programs do).  In this case, the {\tt break} statement allows
us to exit the loop as soon as we detect the end of file.

\index{break statement}
\index{statement!break}
\index{getline}

It is important to exit the loop between the input statement and
the output statement, so that when {\tt getline} fails at the
end of the file, we do not output the invalid data in {\tt line}.

\section{File output}
\index{file output}
\index{ofstream}

Sending output to a file is similar.  For example, we could
modify the previous program to copy lines from one file to
another.

\begin{lstlisting}
  ifstream infile ("input-file");
  ofstream outfile ("output-file");

  if (infile.good() == false || outfile.good() == false) {
    cout << "Unable to open one of the files." << endl;
    exit (1);
  }

  while (true) {
    getline (infile, line);
    if (infile.eof()) break;
    outfile << line << endl;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Parsing input}
\label{parsing}
\index{parsing}

In Section~\ref{formal} I defined ``parsing'' as the process of
analyzing the structure of a sentence in a natural language or a
statement in a formal language.  For example, the compiler has to
parse your program before it can translate it into machine language.

In addition, when you read input from a file or from the keyboard
you often have to parse it in order to extract the information
you want and detect errors.

For example, I have a file called {\tt distances} that contains
information about the distances between major cities in the
United States.  I got this information from a randomly-chosen
web page\footnote{This page is no longer available, but the point stands.}
so it may be wildly inaccurate, but that doesn't matter.  The
format of the file looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
"Atlanta"       "Chicago"       700
"Atlanta"       "Boston"        1,100
"Atlanta"       "Chicago"       700
"Atlanta"       "Dallas"        800
"Atlanta"       "Denver"        1,450
"Atlanta"       "Detroit"       750
"Atlanta"       "Orlando"       400
\end{lstlisting}
%
Each line of the file contains the names of two cities in quotation
marks and the distance between them in miles.  The quotation marks
are useful because they make it easy to deal with names that have
more than one word, like ``San Francisco.''

By searching for the quotation marks in a line of input, we
can find the beginning and end of each city name.
Searching for special characters like quotation marks can be a little
awkward, though, because the quotation mark is a special character
in C++, used to identify string values.

If we want to find the
first appearance of a quotation mark, we have to write something
like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  int index = line.find ('\"');
\end{lstlisting}
%
The argument here looks like a mess, but it represents a single
character, a double quotation mark.  The outermost single-quotes
indicate that this is a character value, as usual.  The backslash
(\verb+\+) indicates that we want to treat the next character
literally.  The sequence \verb+\"+ represents a quotation mark; the
sequence \verb+\'+ represents a single-quote.  Interestingly, the
sequence \verb+\\+ represents a single backslash.  The first backslash
indicates that we should take the second backslash seriously.

\index{special character}
\index{character!special sequence}
\index{backslash}

Parsing input lines consists of finding the beginning and
end of each city name and using
the {\tt substr} function to extract the cities and distance.
{\tt substr} is an {\tt string} member function;
it takes two arguments, the starting index of the substring
and the length.

\index{find}

\begin{lstlisting}
void processLine (const string& line)
{
  // the character we are looking for is a quotation mark
  char quote = '\"';

  // store the indices of the quotation marks in a vector
  vector<int> quoteIndex (4);

  // find the first quotation mark using the built-in find
  quoteIndex[0] = line.find (quote);

  // find the other quotation marks using the find from Chapter 7
  for (int i=1; i<4; i++) {
    quoteIndex[i] = find (line, quote, quoteIndex[i-1]+1);
  }

  // break the line up into substrings
  int len1 = quoteIndex[1] - quoteIndex[0] - 1;
  string city1 = line.substr (quoteIndex[0]+1, len1);
  int len2 = quoteIndex[3] - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
  string city2 = line.substr (quoteIndex[2]+1, len2);
  int len3 = line.length() - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
  string distString = line.substr (quoteIndex[3]+1, len3);

  // output the extracted information
  cout << city1 << "\t" << city2 << "\t" << distString << endl;
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Of course, just displaying the extracted information is not
exactly what we want, but it is a good starting place.

\section{Parsing numbers}
\index{parsing number}
\index{atoi}
\index{convert!to integer}

The next task is to convert the numbers in the file from strings to
integers.  When people write large numbers, they often use commas to
group the digits, as in 1,750.  Most of the time when computers write
large numbers, they don't include commas, and the built-in functions
for reading numbers usually can't handle them.  That makes the
conversion a little more difficult, but it also provides an
opportunity to write a comma-stripping function, so that's ok.  Once
we get rid of the commas, we can use the library function {\tt atoi}
to convert to integer.  {\tt atoi} is defined in the header file {\tt
cstdlib}.

\index{character!classification}
\index{isdigit}

To get rid of the commas, one option is to traverse the string and
check whether each character is a digit.  If so, we add it to the
result string.  At the end of the loop, the result string contains all
the digits from the original string, in order.

\begin{lstlisting}
int convertToInt (const string& s)
{
  string digitString = "";

  for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
    if (isdigit (s[i])) {
      digitString += s[i];
    }
  }
  return atoi (digitString.c_str());
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
The variable {\tt digitString} is an example of an {\bf accumulator}.  It is
similar to the counter we saw in Section~\ref{loopcount},
except that instead of getting incremented, it gets accumulates
one new character at a time, using string concatentation.

The expression

\begin{lstlisting}
      digitString += s[i];
\end{lstlisting}
%
is equivalent to

\begin{lstlisting}
      digitString = digitString + s[i];
\end{lstlisting}
%
Both statements add a single character onto the end of the existing
string.

\index{concatentation}
\index{string!concatentation}
\index{accumulator}
\index{pattern!accumulator}

Since {\tt atoi} takes a C string as a parameter, we have
to convert {\tt digitString} to a C string before passing it
as an argument.

\section{The {\tt Set} data structure}
\index{Set}
\index{data structure}

A data structure is a container for grouping a collection
of data into a single object.  We have seen some examples already,
including {\tt string}s, which are collections of characters,
and {\tt vector}s which are collections on any type.

An ordered set is a collection of items with two defining
properties:

\begin{description}

\item[Ordering:] The elements of the set have indices associated
with them.  We can use these indices to identify elements of the set.

\item[Uniqueness:] No element appears in the set more than once.
If you try to add an element to a set, and it already exists, there
is no effect.

\end{description}

In addition, our implementation of an ordered set will have the
following property:

\begin{description}

\item[Arbitrary size:] As we add elements to the set, it expands
to make room for new elements.

\end{description}

Both {\tt string}s and {\tt vector}s have an ordering; every
element has an index we can use to identify it.  Both none of
the data structures we have seen so far have the properties of
uniqueness or arbitrary size.

\index{ordering}

To achieve uniqueness, we have to write an {\tt add} function
that searches the set to see if it already exists.  To make the
set expand as elements are added, we can take advantage of the
{\tt resize} function on {\tt vector}s.

Here is the beginning of a class definition for a {\tt Set}.

\begin{lstlisting}
class Set {
private:
  vector<string> elements;
  int numElements;

public:
  Set (int n);

  int getNumElements () const;
  string getElement (int i) const;
  int find (const string& s) const;
  int add (const string& s);
};

Set::Set (int n)
{
  vector<string> temp (n);
  elements = temp;
  numElements = 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
The instance variables are an {\tt vector} of strings and an
integer that keeps track of how many elements there are in the
set.  Keep in mind that the number of elements in the
set, {\tt numElements}, is not the same thing as the size
of the {\tt vector}.  Usually it will be smaller.

\index{constructor}

The {\tt Set} constructor takes a single parameter, which is
the initial size of the {\tt vector}.  The initial number
of elements is always zero.

{\tt getNumElements} and {\tt getElement} are accessor functions
for the instance variables, which are private.  {\tt numElements}
is a read-only variable, so we provide a {\tt get} function
but not a {\tt set} function.

\begin{lstlisting}
int Set::getNumElements () const
{
  return numElements;
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Why do we have to prevent client programs from changing {\tt
getNumElements}?  What are the invariants for this type, and
how could a client program break an invariant.  As we look
at the rest of the {\tt Set} member function, see if you can
convince yourself that they all maintain the invariants.

\index{data encapsulation}
\index{encapsulation!data}

When we use the {\tt []} operator to access the {\tt vector},
it checks to make sure the index is greater than or equal to zero
and less than the length of the {\tt vector}.  To access the
elements of a set, though, we need to check a stronger condition.
The index has to be less than the number of elements, which 
might be smaller than the length of the {\tt vector}.

\begin{lstlisting}
string Set::getElement (int i) const
{
  if (i < numElements) {
    return elements[i];
  } else {
    cout << "Set index out of range." << endl;
    exit (1);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
If {\tt getElement} gets an index that is out of range, it prints
an error message (not the most useful message, I admit), and
exits.

\index{run-time error}

The interesting functions are {\tt find} and {\tt add}.  By
now, the pattern for traversing and searching should be old
hat:

\begin{lstlisting}
int Set::find (const string& s) const
{
  for (int i=0; i<numElements; i++) {
    if (elements[i] == s) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
So that leaves us with {\tt add}.  Often the return type for
something like {\tt add} would be void, but in this case it
might be useful to make it return the index of the element.

\begin{lstlisting}
int Set::add (const string& s)
{
  // if the element is already in the set, return its index
  int index = find (s);
  if (index != -1) return index;

  // if the vector is full, double its size
  if (numElements == elements.length()) {
    elements.resize (elements.length() * 2);
  }

  // add the new elements and return its index
  index = numElements;
  elements[index] = s;
  numElements++;
  return index;
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
The tricky thing here is that {\tt numElements} is used in
two ways.  It is the number of elements in the set, of course,
but it is also the index of the next element to be added.

It takes a minute to convince yourself that that works, but
consider this: when the number of elements is zero, the index
of the next element is 0.  When the number of elements is
equal to the length of the {\tt vector}, that means that the
vector is full, and we have to allocate more space (using
{\tt resize}) before we can add the new element.

\index{state diagram}

Here is a state diagram showing a {\tt Set} object that
initially contains space for 2 elements.

\vspace {0.1in}
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=set.eps,width=6in}}
\vspace {0.1in}

Now we can use the {\tt Set} class to keep track of the cities
we find in the file.  In {\tt main} we create the {\tt Set} with
an initial size of 2:

\begin{lstlisting}
  Set cities (2);
\end{lstlisting}
%
Then in {\tt processLine} we add both cities to the {\tt Set}
and store the index that gets returned.

\begin{lstlisting}
  int index1 = cities.add (city1);
  int index2 = cities.add (city2);
\end{lstlisting}
%
I modified {\tt processLine} to take the {\tt cities} object
as a second parameter.

\section {{\tt apmatrix}}
\index{matrix}
\index{apmatrix}

An {\tt apmatrix} is similar to an {\tt vector} except it
is two-dimensional.  Instead of a length, it has two
dimensions, called {\tt numrows} and {\tt numcols}, for
``number of rows'' and ``number of columns.''

Each element in the matrix is indentified by two indices;
one specifies the row number, the other the column number.

\index{index}

To create a matrix, there are four constructors:

\begin{lstlisting}
  apmatrix<char> m1;
  apmatrix<int> m2 (3, 4);
  apmatrix<double> m3 (rows, cols, 0.0);
  apmatrix<double> m4 (m3);
\end{lstlisting}
%
The first is a do-nothing constructor that makes a matrix with both
dimensions 0.  The second takes two integers, which are the initial
number of rows and columns, in that order.  The third is the same as
the second, except that it takes an additional parameter that is used
to initialized the elements of the matrix.  The fourth is a copy
constructor that takes another {\tt apmatrix} as a parameter.

\index{constructor}

Just as with {\tt vectors}, we can make {\tt apmatrix}es with any
type of elements (including {\tt vector}s, and even {\tt
apmatrix}es).

To access the elements of a matrix, we use the {\tt []} operator
to specify the row and column:

\begin{lstlisting}
  m2[0][0] = 1;
  m3[1][2] = 10.0 * m2[0][0];
\end{lstlisting}
%
If we try to access an element that is out of range, the program
prints an error message and quits.

\index{run-time error}

The {\tt numrows} and {\tt numcols} functions get the number of
rows and columns.  Remember that the row indices run from 0 to
{\tt numrows() -1} and the column indices run from 0 to
{\tt numcols() -1}.

\index{loop!nested}

The usual way to traverse a matrix is with a nested loop.
This loop sets each element of the matrix to the sum of its
two indices:

\begin{lstlisting}
  for (int row=0; row < m2.numrows(); row++) {
    for (int col=0; col < m2.numcols(); col++) {
      m2[row][col] = row + col;
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
%
This loop prints each row of the matrix with tabs between the
elements and newlines between the rows:

\begin{lstlisting}
  for (int row=0; row < m2.numrows(); row++) {
    for (int col=0; col < m2.numcols(); col++) {
      cout << m2[row][col] << "\t";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
\end{lstlisting}
%

\section{A distance matrix}

Finally, we are ready to put the data from the file into
a matrix.  Specifically, the matrix will have one row and
one column for each city.

We'll create the matrix in {\tt main}, with plenty of space
to spare:

\begin{lstlisting}
  apmatrix<int> distances (50, 50, 0);
\end{lstlisting}
%

Inside {\tt processLine}, we add new information to the
matrix by getting the indices of the two cities from the
{\tt Set} and using them as matrix indices:

\begin{lstlisting}
  int dist = convertToInt (distString);
  int index1 = cities.add (city1);
  int index2 = cities.add (city2);

  distances[index1][index2] = distance;
  distances[index2][index1] = distance;
\end{lstlisting}
%
Finally, in {\tt main} we can print the information in a
human-readable form:

\begin{lstlisting}
  for (int i=0; i<cities.getNumElements(); i++) {
    cout << cities.getElement(i) << "\t";

    for (int j=0; j<=i; j++) {
      cout << distances[i][j] << "\t";
    }
    cout << endl;
  }

  cout << "\t";
  for (int i=0; i<cities.getNumElements(); i++) {
    cout << cities.getElement(i) << "\t";
  }
  cout << endl;
\end{lstlisting}
%
This code produces the output shown at the beginning of the
chapter.  The original data is available from this book's web page.

\section{A proper distance matrix}

Although this code works, it is not as well organized as it
should be.  Now that we have written a prototype, we are in a
good position to evaluate the design and improve it.

What are some of the problems with the existing code?

\begin{enumerate}

\item We did not know ahead of time how big to make the distance
matrix, so we chose an arbitrary large number (50) and made it
a fixed size.  It would be better to allow the distance matrix
to expand in the same way a {\tt Set} does.  The {\tt apmatrix}
class has a function called {\tt resize} that makes this possible.

\index{resize}

\item The data in the distance matrix is not well-encapsulated.
We have to pass the set of city names and the matrix itself
as arguments to {\tt processLine}, which is awkward.  Also,
use of the distance matrix is error prone because we have not
provided accessor functions that perform error-checking.
It might be a good idea to take the {\tt Set} of city names
and the {\tt apmatrix} of distances, and combine them into a
single object called a {\tt DistMatrix}.

\end{enumerate}

Here is a draft of what the header for a {\tt DistMatrix}
might look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
class DistMatrix {
private:
  Set cities;
  apmatrix<int> distances;

public:
  DistMatrix (int rows);

  void add (const string& city1, const string& city2, int dist);
  int distance (int i, int j) const;
  int distance (const string& city1, const string& city2) const;
  string cityName (int i) const;
  int numCities () const;
  void print ();
};
\end{lstlisting}
%
Using this interface simplifies {\tt main}:

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;


int main ()
{
  string line;
  ifstream infile ("distances");
  DistMatrix distances (2);

  while (true) {
    getline (infile, line);
    if (infile.eof()) break;
    processLine (line, distances);
  }

  distances.print ();
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
It also simplifies {\tt processLine}:

\begin{lstlisting}
void processLine (const string& line, DistMatrix& distances)
{
  char quote = '\"';
  vector<int> quoteIndex (4);
  quoteIndex[0] = line.find (quote);
  for (int i=1; i<4; i++) {
    quoteIndex[i] = find (line, quote, quoteIndex[i-1]+1);
  }

  // break the line up into substrings
  int len1 = quoteIndex[1] - quoteIndex[0] - 1;
  string city1 = line.substr (quoteIndex[0]+1, len1);
  int len2 = quoteIndex[3] - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
  string city2 = line.substr (quoteIndex[2]+1, len2);
  int len3 = line.length() - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
  string distString = line.substr (quoteIndex[3]+1, len3);
  int distance = convertToInt (distString);

  // add the new datum to the distances matrix
  distances.add (city1, city2, distance);
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
I will leave it as an exercise to you to implement the
member functions of {\tt DistMatrix}.


\section{Glossary}

\begin{description}

\item[ordered set:]  A data structure in which every element appears
only once and every element has an index that identifies it.

sequence of data items from one place to another.  In C++ streams
are used for input and output.

\item[accumulator:]  A variable used inside a loop to accumulate
a result, often by getting something added or concatenated during each
iteration.
